## 💻 System Requirements:

* `ffmpeg` must be installed and available in your system `PATH`.
* `python` must be installed and available in your system `PATH`.

### 🔨 Installing packages:

```bash
pip install guessit requests colorama
```
### 🔨 How to use the noob installer for Linux:
```
sudo chmod +x noob-install-by-motanu.sh
./noob-install-by-motanu.sh
Works and tested on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, Arch/Manjaro, openSUSE, Alpine.

Or if you use arm...

sudo chmod +x arm-noob-install-motan.sh
./arm-noob-install-motan.sh

AARCH64 should work fine on these:
- Ubuntu (22.04 & 24.04).
- Linux Mint (21 & 22 & 22.3).
- Debian (11 & 12).
- Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm and Bullseye).
- Arch linux.
- Manjaro.
- Fedora (38 & 39 & 40).
- openSUSE (Leap & Tumbleweed).
- Alpine 3.18+

ARMV6 & ARMV7 should work fine on these:
- Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm and Bullseye).
- Debian (11 & 12).

❗ Partially working / limited: ❗
- Fedora on armv7 (Fedora dropped 32-bit arm since F37).
- Alpine on armv6 (build FFmpeg from source).
- RHEL & CentOS (FFmpeg not in base repos, needs EPEL + RPM Fusion added manually).
- Ubuntu 20.04 (python3-venv may need manual install).

❌ !!!! NOT COMPATIBLE WITH Gentoo, NixOS, Void Linux, Slackware, Android (Termux) !!!! ❌
❌ !!!! We will not provide support for issues you will encounter on aarch64 & armv6 & armv7 !!!! ❌
```
### 🔨 Windows:
```
Just run the executable either from release either from the repository.
Or if you are feeling freaky you can use the batch file.

Soon: Windows ARM installer | ❗ But we will not help you with any issues that you will encounter. ❗
```
### 🔨 MacOS with Apple Silicon SoC:
```
❗ You are on your own but we will give you the sources you need. ❗
❌ We can not help you with any issues that you will encounter. ❌

There are multiple sources of ffmpeg for Apple Silicon, and each have their ups and downs,it's up to you to use the best one for you.
1. https://github.com/Vargol/ffmpeg-apple-arm64-build?tab=readme-ov-file
2. https://gitlab.com/martinr92/ffmpeg
3. https://osxexperts.net/
Now you will need Python:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3144/

❗❗❗❗ Note: We do not know how any of this will work with the new MacBook Neo, because it is
slighty diffrent from their M SoC series, and we do not own one so we can not test it. ❗❗❗❗
```

### 🔨 MacOS with Intel CPU:
```
❗❗❗❗ You are on your own but we will give you the sources you need. ❗❗❗❗
❌ We can not help you with any issues that you will encounter. ❌
